I’m Emily Yue-ting Jia, an undergraduate student from Tsinghua University. It’s my fourth year at Tsinghua and I will graduate in 2023.I plan to go on for Doctor’s degree in US after graduation.
My main research interest is computer vision and I have done some research under the guidance of [Prof. Li Yi](https://ericyi.github.io) and [Prof. Yushen Liu](https://yushen-liu.github.io). I’m also interested in operating system and have done some research about micro kernel for VM image as graduation program under the guidance of [Prof. Yu Chen](http://soft.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~chen/).
