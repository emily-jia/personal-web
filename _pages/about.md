I'm Emily Yue-ting Jia, a Ph.D. student at University of Southern California. I'm co-advised by [Prof. Yajie Zhao](https://www.yajie-zhao.com/) and [Prof. Yue Wang](https://yuewang.xyz/). I'm interested in 3D computer vison and my current research focuses on 3D reconstruction. I received my bachelor's degree from Tsinghua University, where I was lucky to work with [Prof. Li Yi](https://ericyi.github.io) and [Prof. Yushen Liu](https://yushen-liu.github.io).
